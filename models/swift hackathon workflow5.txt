workflow
1. user subscribes to green bond (/submitTx) submit tx to swift and add transaction into queue

2. subscribe to notification service based on uetr using webhook

3. Payment done on swift and status is updated using swift SLVP (SWIFT tracker low value payments) API 

4. Track payment using (uetr swift endpoint)
	- using scheduler at 10s interval until transaction is completed?
	- polling?

5. Once payment goes through, send notification to webhook url (custom node endpoint to receive notification)

6. notification triggers workflow to transfer bond (smart contract) to subscriber

7. issuer can trigger coupon payments by calling function in smart contract to disburse payment to holders of the bond.
   payment details (calculated in smart contract)

8. coupon payments (also using SLVP API)

9. check wallet balances using /queryContract

10. check kyc and reject transaction

BLOCKCHAIN TASKS
create bond/uetr smart contract (blockchain) (naresh / niveetha)
create scheduler to poll for notification (blockchain)
create service to handle transfer of bond to investor (blockchain)
create service and endpoint to query for archived swift messages in the blockchain (blockchain) 

SWIFT TASKS
investigate subscription and notification api (swift)
investigate swift transaction and update transaction api (swift)
investigate swift uetr
investigate swift check BIC, IBAN endpoints.


POSTMAN APIS
subscribe to bond
check transaction status
check wallet balance
get swift messages from blockchain
trigger coupon payment from issuer
